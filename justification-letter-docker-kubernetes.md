# Docker Kubernetes bootcamp justification letter

*This is a sample letter that you can use/edit when requesting to attend the Docker Kubernetes bootcamp on August 25th. If possible, you could also list current project/s where this knowledge might help you in your work.*

Hello ____________,

DevOps Represent and Indigitek have partnered to provide a full day of learning Docker and Kubernetes. I’m asking for your approval and funding to attend.

Docker and Kubernetes are the number 1 technologies in containerisation and management of modern applications and services. This helps create continuously deployable and resilient applications.

Ticket cost is $116.59AUD

As part of ticket cost, I’ll be getting:
* Training delivered from experienced technology folks who work with Docker and Kubernetes as part of real-world applications
* A support team on standby to spend one-on-one time with people who would like to ask extra questions/get extra help
* 1 hour of set-up support prior to the event kicking off
* Exclusive DevOps Represent training content to keep
* A certificate of attendance
* Networking opportunity with other people from the technology industry and an opportunity to meet new people

The event will be run as a virtual event on Tuesday, the 25th of August from 8.45am-5pm (AEDT).

Proceeds from ticket sales will be going directly to Indigitek. This will goes towards supporting their important work to build opportunities and pathways for First Nations people to participate in science, technology, engineering, arts and maths (STEAM).
